# Contributing

We appreciate the help. You're the best. üëç

### 1. Check out the [Issue Tracker](/../../issues)

Maybe we're already fixing the issue. If not...

### 2. Start a discussion in the [Gitter Room](https://gitter.im/figaro-tech/go-figaro)

Where does your contribution fit into our timeline? Is it a bug other people are seeing? Is it a feature other people want? Let's figure it out together.

### 3. Make a contribution.

We try to keep contribution pretty consistent across our repositories. Give these a quick read and report back!
